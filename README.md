### Location Optimizer

This site gives a user the ability to compare multiple locations and find the cheapest transport costs when choosing a site. 
The user can upload a lost of potential central sites and a list of delivery sites and this website will calculate the
distances to return the optimum location, based on calls to the Google Distance API.
